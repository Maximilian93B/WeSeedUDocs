### WeSeedU Business Plan

#### Executive Summary

WeSeedU is an early-stage investment platform focused on sustainable innovation and technology startups. The platform connects purpose-driven founders with values-aligned investors through a curated selection of high-quality, vetted opportunities. WeSeedU differentiates itself with a suite of features designed to foster transparency, trust, and engagement. These include secure investor communities, third-party startup evaluations, and an AI-powered news agent that delivers personalized insights.

### Market Opportunity

* **Crowdfunding Market Growth**: Global crowdfunding is projected to grow from \$1.5B in 2023 to \$5.4B by 2032 (15.4% CAGR).
* **Investor Interest**: 77% of investors seek market-rate returns plus social/environmental impact; 54% plan to increase sustainable investments.
* **Trust Gap**: ESG greenwashing concerns highlight the need for transparent, credible platforms—WeSeedU fills this gap via third-party evaluations.
* **Alternative Funding Channels**: Capital exists, but early-stage sustainable startups often lack access; WeSeedU enables that connection.
* **Momentum**: Despite downturns, sustainable startups raised \$9.6B in H1 2024 alone, showing sector resilience and interest.

### Product Overview

* **Curated Startups**: Exclusive listings in sectors like renewable energy, clean tech, and sustainable agriculture. Each company is evaluated and mapped to UN SDGs.
* **Celebrity Ambassadors**: Public figures advocate for each startup, driving trust and visibility.
* **Investor Communities**: Social hubs allow investors to discuss startups, share insights, and peer-trade equity (within legal bounds).
* **Third-Party Due Diligence**: Independent reports from firms like KPMG enhance transparency and investor confidence.
* **AI News Agent**: Custom AI tool curates and summarizes relevant sector news for each investor. Available as a premium feature for subscribed users.

### Business Model

WeSeedU’s revenue model is centered on a flexible 10% success fee per company, structured based on the amount of capital raised.

* **Tiered Success Fee Structure**: The more a company raises, the lower the percentage WeSeedU charges—while smaller raises may incur a higher fee to offset onboarding and due diligence costs. This approach ensures fairness while supporting smaller, early-stage ventures.
* **Fee Options**:

  * **Hybrid Model**: A mix of cash and equity (e.g., 5% in cash and 5% in equity).
  * **Equity-Only Model**: Taking a 10% equity stake in lieu of cash to align long-term interests.
  * **Cash-Only Model**: Charging a full 10% of the capital raised in cash.
* **Secondary Market Revenue**: WeSeedU facilitates peer-to-peer security exchanges between verified investors. A transaction fee (e.g., 3–5%) will be charged for each trade, with WeSeedU handling compliance and execution.
* **Cash Account Integration**: Users will be able to open cash accounts to purchase securities based on platform-defined investment minimums. This feature streamlines the investment process while ensuring regulatory compliance.
* **AI News Agent Subscription**: Access to the AI-powered news agent will be offered as a premium feature. Investors can subscribe on a monthly or annual basis to receive curated, real-time insights tailored to their portfolio and sustainability interests. This not only adds value for active users but also creates a recurring revenue stream independent of deal flow.

This performance-driven model aligns WeSeedU’s success with that of the startups it supports. The structure is designed to maximize platform value while maintaining fairness and accessibility across a wide range of deals.
